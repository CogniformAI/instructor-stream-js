# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

The workspace uses pnpm; the new Effect runtime and service graph live under `packages/instructor-stream/src/effect/`, LangGraph utilities under `src/langgraph/`, and shared helpers in `src/utils/`. Unit tests sit beside code in `__tests__` folders. Legacy code has been removed; all new work should target the Effect pipeline. Provider adapters for integrations remain in `packages/providers/src` with tests in `packages/providers/tests/`. Examples and benchmarking harnesses reside in `packages/examples/` and `packages/benchmarks/`. Builds emit to each package `dist/`, while shared configs (`tsconfig.json`, `.prettierrc`, `.oxlintrc.json`) and MkDocs content under `docs/` live at the repo root.

## Build, Test & Development Commands

Install dependencies via `pnpm install`. Use `pnpm --filter @cogniformai/instructor-stream run dev` for watch-mode builds or `pnpm dev` to watch all packages. `pnpm build` fans out `tsup` builds, and `pnpm typecheck` runs workspace TypeScript. Guard style with `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, and fix using `pnpm format`. Run unit suites through `pnpm test`; add coverage with `pnpm --filter @cogniformai/instructor-stream run test:coverage`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Code ships as TypeScript ES modules. Prettier enforces two-space indentation, 100-character lines, single quotes, and no semicolons while `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` keeps import groups orderly. `oxlint` replaces ESLint and promotes strict TypeScript hygiene—avoid `any`, prefer explicit return types, and keep test overrides only in `.test.ts`. The `@` alias targets `packages/instructor-stream/src`; use `.ts` filenames for source and reserve `.d.ts` for generated types.

## Testing Guidelines

Vitest covers unit, integration, and benchmarks. Name specs `*.test.ts` under `src/__tests__/` or `tests/` so they match the `vitest.config.ts` include glob. Use `pnpm --filter @cogniformai/instructor-stream run test:watch` while iterating and `pnpm --filter @cogniformai/instructor-stream run test:integration` only when provider API keys are available in `.secrets` (see `.secrets.example`). Coverage reports land in `coverage/`; avoid checking them in unless intentionally updating artifacts.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow the prevailing conventional commit style seen in history (`fix: normalize langgraph content indices`, `chore: prepare 0.2.3 manual release`). Release commits remain `Release X.Y.Z`. Each PR should include a clear summary, linked issues in the description, and validation notes (e.g., `pnpm -C packages/instructor-stream test`). Attach screenshots or logs when behavior changes user-facing streams. Request review from a maintainer and wait for CI green checks before merging.

## Manual Release Checklist (npm)

Use this flow for the 0.2.x line while we’re publishing by hand:

1. **Prep the workspace**
   - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
   - `pnpm run pre-push`
   - `pnpm -C packages/instructor-stream build`
2. **Update release metadata**
   - Bump the version in `packages/instructor-stream/package.json`
   - Add a matching entry at the top of `packages/instructor-stream/CHANGELOG.md`
   - Stage those files plus any source changes destined for the release
3. **Commit**
   - Commit as `Release X.Y.Z` (e.g. `Release 0.2.7`)
4. **Tag and push**
   - `git tag vX.Y.Z`
   - `git push origin main`
   - `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
5. **Publish to npm**
   - `pnpm publish --filter @cogniformai/instructor-stream --access public`
6. **Post-publish**
   - Draft GitHub release notes (copy from CHANGELOG)
   - Announce internally if needed

# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

# Effect Migration

- Check the `MIGRATION.md` file with the rules and style of Effect that we are going to use. Always refer to the MIGRATION file and double check that you are follwoing the right conventions for Effect
- Take advantage of Typescript, for easier itteration. This will help find small errors throught the codebase.
- DO NOT worry about backwards compatibilty and by this I mean I dont want half the code in one runtime and half in another, If we are going to migrate this to Effect, then its go big or go home. I want this to be using the Effect runtime and all of its built-ins where possible.

NOTE: The effect docs are in the `effect-docs` folder at the root of the project.
